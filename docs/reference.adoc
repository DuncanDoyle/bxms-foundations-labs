upgrade to pam72
    1) Move it off of the shared elab cluster (na311). we have a lot of problems in this environment. This course will run in ravello VMs just like the DM7 courses and the upcoming case mgmt courses. 
    2) Use Bernard's PAM 7.2 ansible as the basis 
    3) Modify the course ansible so that all that would remain would be: https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/blob/development/ansible/roles/ocp-workload-bxms-pam/tasks/workload.yml#L88-L93 
    4) Update set-up lab of this course to reflect new environment. 
    5) Tag course so that LMSs are updated.
