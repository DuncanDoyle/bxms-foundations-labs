== Assets Navigation Lab

This module showcases the Business Central environment provisioned during the _Environment Setup Lab_. The business assets are retrieved from the `Mortgage Demo` project, one of the demonstration projects available on https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/rhpam7-mortgage-demo-repo[JBoss Demo Central].

In this lab, you will import the `Mortgage Demo` project in the Business Central workbench of Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.
You will navigate the project's assets, like process definitions, rules and forms, in the project's library.
You will build and deploy the project onto the the Process Server, the platform's ligth-weight runtime engine, after which we will start a Mortgage Application process instance.
Finally, you will explore the runtime process and task management using the process instance created in the previous step.

.Goals

== Import Project

The Business Central project library view is displayed when you click *Design* from the Business Central home page, or when you naviage the menu: *Menu -> Design -> Projects*.

The project library view shows available projects in the library. If the library is empty, it shows "Nothing Here":

image::images/empty-library-perspective.png[]

With an empty project library view, you have the option to create a project, try a sample, or import an existing project.

In this lab we will import an existing project, the `Mortgage Demo` from the https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/rhpam7-mortgage-demo-repo[JBoss Demo Central Github repository].

. From the empty project library view, click *Import Project*.
* Expect to see an *Import Project* dialog where you specify a Git repository URL for the project.
. In the *Import Project* dialog, enter `https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/rhpam7-mortgage-demo-repo` for *Repository URL* and click *Import*:
+
image::images/import_pamf_lab2.png[]
* If the repository contains multiple projects, you will be asked which project you would like to import. In this case the repository only contains the `Mortgage Demo` project, which will be imported immedetialy.
* When the import is completed, the project library view appears with the `Mortgage Demo` project selected:
+

== Navigate Project Library

The project library view shows a tabular list of the assets in the project.
The tabular list allows the user to:

* Filter assets by type.
* Search for assets.
* Navigate between asset pages.

=== Filter assets by type
At the top left of the tabular list of assets, you see drop-down list. The list allows you to filter the assets by type.

image::images/filter_assets_by_type.png[]

. Filter on `Process`
. Filter on `Decision`
. Filter on `Model`
. Filter on `Form`
. Set the filter to `All`

=== Search for Assets

At the top of the tabular list of assets, you see a search input field.
The grid is filtered by the asset's fully-qualified name, and the match is not case-sensitive.

image::images/search_by_name.png[]

. Search for `gdst`.
. Search for `Mortage`.
. Search for `Validate`.
. Clear the search field.

=== Navigate between asset pages

At the top right of the tabular list of assets, there is a pagination control that allows the user to navigate between pages.

. Find the page controller.
. Navigate to the next page and back.

=== Explore the Process Definition
. In the Asset Library view, use the asset filter to filter on *Processes*
. Open the `MortageApplication` process, this is the process we will be using in the remainder of this lab.
. In the process designer, explore the process. Identify the different BPMN2 constructs used, like *Business Rule Task*, *Human Task*, *X-OR Gateway* and *Swimlane*.
. Try to follow a process path from start to finish, and get a high-level understanding of the process semantics.

== Download Project

Projects can be exported so you can use them to upload to a source code repository and import them later into another instance of Business Central or distribute them outside the environment where they were created.

=== Export Project

To export the project, you start from Business Central's home page.

. Click the *Home* icon from the upper panel to access the Business Central home page.
. Click *Design* to display the project list.
* Note that the empty project library view you saw earlier is now populated with the `Mortgage Demo`.
. Select the `Mortgage Demo` project.
* This shows the project's library view with a list of its assets.
. Select the `Applicant` asset, the second asset in the table, and if the *Project Explorer* panel is not displayed, click the blue *>* icon to open it.
* This opens the *Project Explorer* perspective:
+
image::images/project-explorer-perspective.png[]
*  The *Project Explorer* view is accessible only when you select any of the assets from the project's library view.
. Click the gear icon in the *Project Explorer* panel and select *Download Project*
to trigger the download in your browser:
+
image::images/settings-gear.png[]
* A ZIP file containing the package structure of your project is downloaded to your `Downloads` folder. The name of the ZIP file is structured like this: `[Space Name]-[Repository Name]_[project name].zip`.
* Expect to find a file called `MySpace_examples-rhpam7-mortgage-demo-repo.zip` in your `Downloads` folder.
+
[NOTE]
In some cases, the file name may be missing a `[Space Name]-` prefix.

=== Deploy Mortgages Demonstration Project

It is useful to know how to create an executable component from a project. Executable components are stored in a binary repository (Maven) so that they can be used as dependencies for other projects. Executable components are also distributed to _execution servers_. Execution servers are the runtime containers that allow process execution from the Business Central workbench and client applications.

In this section, you deploy the `Mortgage Demo` demonstration project and use the Business Central workbench to test the deployment.

The `Mortgage Demo` demonstration project is a Process Automation Manager project intended to demonstrate the use of Process Server to execute a Mortgage Application business  process.

. Click the *Home* icon from the upper panel to access the Decision Central home page.
. Click *Design* to show the project list.
. Select the `Mortgage Demo ` project.
* This shows the project's library view with a list of its assets.
. Click *Deploy* from the set of buttons in the upper right.
* Expect to see confirmation of a successful deployment.
. Click the *Home* icon from the upper panel.
. Click *Deploy* to display the *Deploy* perspective.
* This shows the list of servers and containers:
* Alternatively, you can click *Menu -> Deploy -> Execution Servers* to navigate to the server page.
+
image::images/servers-and-containers.png[]
. Verify that the `mortgage_1` KIE container shows a green circle with a checkmark, indicating successful deployment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Note that the IP address for the remote server is an internal host IP address for the OpenShift environment. This means that while the IP address is accessible from within the OpenShift platform components, you cannot access this IP address from outside the OpenShift environment--for example, from your browser.
In order to access the KIE containers from outside the OpenShift environment, you need a Process Server route, which you get from the list of pods in OpenShift Container Platform.
====
. If you are not already logged in to OpenShift Container Platform, log in using your OPENTLC credentials:
+
image::images/ocp-login.png[]

. Select the Process Automation Manager project from your project list:
+
image::images/projects-list.png[]

. Locate the Process Server deployment whose name begins with `gpte-kieserver` in the list and click the *>* icon to the left to display details of this deployment:
+
image::images/external-route-execution-server.png[]
**TODO: UPDATE IMAGE!**

. From the *Networking* section in the Process Server pod, select one of the entries under *ROUTES External Traffic* and open the link in a new window.
. By default the Process Server route needs additional details about the information that you are requesting.
* Expect to see a `Forbidden` message result:
+
image::images/execution-server-forbidden.png[]
**TODO: UPDATE IMAGE**

. Add `/docs` to the end of the URL in your browser route.
* Expect to see the KIE server remote API reference documentation:
+
image::images/execution-server-rest-api.png[]
. Navigate to the **KIE Server :: Core** section.
. Click on the **GET /server/conainers** entry to expand the section.
. Click on the *Try it out* button on the right.
. Leave all the fields empty and click on the *Execute* button.
. The *Server Response* section will show the response confirming the existence of the the `mortgage` container.
+
image::images/swagger-get-containers.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====
The RESTful endpoint of Process Server are _secured resources_. This means that you need to present credentials to access the resource, for example when you press the _Execute_ button in the API documentation. You use the same credentials (`adminUser` for the username and `test1234!` for the password) that you used for entering Decision Central from the _Environment Setup Lab_ .
====


== Execute Test Cases

In this section, you execute a number of test scenarios:

* A mortgage application with human task that requests increase of downpayment and manual appraisal. Mortgage will be accepted.
* A mortgage application with human task that requests increase of downpayment and manager task to manually approve the appliction. Mortgage will be denied.


=== Test Approved Mortgage Loan Application

In this section, you use the following example data to generate an approved response from the engine:
