.Goals
* Provision the Process Automation Manager in an OpenShift environment

:numbered:

== Overview

TO-DO:  Update these links for PAM once GA

The Red Hat Process Automation Manager product can be provisioned in either of the following environments:

. Any combination of JVM, OS and application container detailed in the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/3354301[Red Hat Process Automation Manager Support Configurations document].
+
The installation procedure for this approach can be found in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_decision_manager/7.0/html-single/installing_red_hat_decision_manager_on_premise/index[supported product documentation].
+
This lab does not discuss this installation approach.
. In an OpenShift Container Platform environment
+
The focus of this lab is on this approach.
+
Related documentation on this installation procedure can also be found link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_decision_manager/7.0/html-single/deploying_red_hat_decision_manager_on_red_hat_openshift_container_platform/index[here].

The Process Automation Manager product will be provisioned in a single remote Openshift project.
For the purpose of this lab, this single remote OpenShift project is provided to you; you do not need to install the OpenShift Container Platform.

.. *Name*: bxms-pam-manual-provision-<your initials>
.. *Display Name*: Manually Provisioned Process Automation Manager
.. *Description*: Manually Provisioned Process Automation Manager

. Click on the new project and navigate to the following to view Quotas and Limit Ranges: `Resources -> Quota`
.. The top section details the `ClusterQuota` assigned to your user account.
+
It is set by the OpenShift system administrator to define resource limits at an aggregate level.
.. The bottom section details the `LimitRange` automatically assigned to your OCP project.
+
It also is set by the OpenShift system administrator to define limits and defaults on individual pods and containers.

The clusterquota and limitranges assigned allow for a successfull deployment of Red Hat Process Automation Manager.

Now that you have access to an OCP lab environment and have created a project, you are now prepared to provision the Red Hat Process Automation Manager product in that project.

== Process Automation Manager template

The Red Hat Process Automation Manager product includes a variety of OpenShift templates that define all of the artifacts to be provisioned for a Process Automation Manager deployment.

=== PAM Template Overview

Details of the list of templates offered are as follows:

. *rhpam70-authoring.yaml*
+
Description: An example of a recommended authoring environment for most customers where scalability and reliability requirements do not rise to levels justifying a high-availability setup.
Technical Content: Single replica of business central configured to use a persistent volume, set up to tightly integrate with an instance of the KIE server, using business central as its Maven repo and persisting process data to H2, backed by a persistent volume.

. *rhpam70-authoring-ha.yaml*
+
Description: An example of a recommended highly-available authoring environment for most customers requiring significant scalability and reliability.
Technical Content: Two default replicas of business central running on an EAP cluster, using elasticsearch and AMQ, and configured with a shared persistent volume, set up to tightly integrate with two replicas of the KIE server, using business central as its Maven repo and persisting process data to PostgreSQL.

. *rhpam70-sit.yaml*
+
Description: An example of a recommended integration testing environment for most customers.

. *rhpam70-prod-immutable-monitor.yaml*
+
Description: An example of a recommended production environment for an expected minority of customers who wish to run immutable containers that cannot be managed.
Technical Content: Three default replicas of business central monitoring, configured for single sign-on with RH-SSO integration, connected to two replicas of the smart router, configured for connection to distinct sets of S2I KIE server images using container-local maven, that can be created through an associated template.

. *rhpam70-prod-immutable-kieserver.yaml*
+
Description: An immutable KIE server used optionally connecting to a monitoring console
Technical Content: Two replica of KIE server using s2i to generate container-local maven data and persisting to PostgreSQL. May optionally point to a smart router and/or monitoring.

. *rhpam70-trial-ephemeral.yaml*
+
Description: A short-living trial environment that can be quickly and easily installed
Technical Content: Business central with ephemeral local git tightly coupled to a KIE server using ephemeral H2 database and pointing to business central as its Maven service.

. *rhpam70-kieserver-postgresql.yaml*
+
Description: An example of a managed KIE server used with a monitoring console
Technical Content: Single replica of KIE server with required configuration to use an external Maven service, and included PostgreSQL database. May optionally point to a smart router.

. *rhpam70-kieserver-mysql.yaml*
+
Description: An example of a managed KIE server used with a monitoring console
Technical Content: Single replica of KIE server with required configuration to use an external Maven service, and included MySQL database. May optionally point to a smart router.

. *rhpam70-kieserver-externaldb.yaml*
+
Description: An example of a managed KIE server used with a monitoring console
Technical Content: Single replica of KIE server with required configuration to use an external Maven service, and required configuration to persist to an external database. May optionally point to a smart router.

These templates can be found link:https://github.com/jboss-container-images/rhpam-7-openshift-image/tree/rhpam70-dev/templates[here].

=== Quiz

Templates are intended to be tweaked as needed by application developers.
For the purpose of this lab, we'll use a {pam_template} that includes slight variations from the out of the box rhpam70-authoring.yaml template.

. Point your browser to the {pam_template} and save a copy to your local filesystem so that you can more easily study it.
. Open the template in a text editor and notice the following about it:
.. The majority of the template consists of a list of `objects:` (starting at around line 19) and a list of template `parameters` (starting at around line 531).
.. There are two `DeploymentConfig` artifacts defined that when started will create two pods:
... _rhdmcentr_ : This defines the details of your `Decision Central` web application.
... _custom-kieserver_ : This defines the details of your _kie-server_ pod where your rule applications run.
+
The customization made to it is that it is CORS enabled to allow a web application to invoke its REST API.

. Study the template and test your understanding of the template by answering the following questions:
.. Are the deployment configs defined in the template initially in a paused state?
.. What are the values of the limits and requests specified for the _kie-server_ pod ?
.. What are the values of the limits and requests specified for the _Decision Central_ pod ?
.. What will be the userId and password to authenticate into the Decision Central web application ?

+
image::images/click_yaml.png[]
. Populate the form as follows:
.. *Add to Project*: Select your project from the selection list.
.. Click `Browse` and select the yaml based template that you previously downloaded to your local filesystem.
. Once the `Create` button is enabled, click it.
+
image::images/import_yaml.png[]
. At the `Add Template` pop-up, ensure the `Process the Template` checkbox is checked and then click `Continue`.
. Change the values of the following template parameters as follows:
.. *Application Name*: rht
.. *KIE Admin Password*: test1234!
. Click `Create`

== Verify

. Return to the homepage of your `Manually Provisioned Process Automation Manager` project.
. Navigate to: `Builds -> Builds`
+
Notice that a build called `rht-custom-kieserver` should be in-progress and working toward completion.
This build artifact layers the Process Automation Manager with CORS related configurations.
+
image::images/ks_build.png[]
. Once the `rht-custom-kieserver` build is in a completed status, navigate to: `Applications -> Deployments`
. There should be two deployments list:
+
.. `rht-kieserver`
.. `rht-rhdmcentr`
. For each of the deployments, start them by clicking on the deployment and in the `Actions` drop-down, select: `Resume Rollouts`
+
image::images/resume_rollout.png[]
. Check on the resultant pods by navigating to: `Applications -> Pods`.
+
Notice that initially there are a couple of pods whose names include a suffix of: `*-deploy`.
. After a few minutes, the `deploy` pods should terminate and you'll be left with two pods in a `Running` state
+
image::images/running_pods.png[]

. Return to the page in the OpenShift web console that provides details of your quotas and limit ranges.
+
Notice that your Process Automation Manager deployment should be well within the limits defined by the ClusterQuota:
+
image::images/cq_inuse.png[]

. Review routes by navigating to: `Applications -> Routes`
. Click on the link of the _Hostname_ associated with the route called:  `secure-rht-rhdmcentr`.
. Accept the self-signed certificates and authenticate at the login prompt using:  `adminUser` / `test1234!`
. Once you login you should be able to see the Decision Central Home perspective:
